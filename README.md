# Advanced_Java_OCCC_2020

This will contain all code, projects and other assorted snippets from this course, many of which might be broken. 
You may use whatever code inside for your own personal or professional use (i bear no responsiblity if it gets you fired in this case).
But i would ask that if you are currently attending this course, that you don't copy and paste these assignments directly.
Why? I can't deny i did similar at points, so who am i to tell you otherwise?

This course, is not designed to be just "Another" step in your degree, a checkbox to mark off.
Nobody told me this, i had to learn it myself. 
But by working the problems, and understanding them for what they are.
You will be both a better programmer, and person by the end.
By all means though, look through these archives if you're stuck. But work with what you have, ask questions about why your code doesn't look like mine.
It could be my code is broken/worse, that you found a better way of doing something i missed.
It could be that you missed a single parenthesis, reversed the order of an assignment operator, etc.
Never just ASSUME your code is bad, just because it doesn't look like something on the net.
Try, compile, fail, make changes, compile again, fail again, then set breakpoints, get knee-deep and really wade through whatever issue you're having.
That is the essence of what you've signed on for, especially if you've gone for software engineering.
And then if you really just don't get it?
Ask for help, and i promise you'll be fine.
